This version is meant as more of an exploration of the language and its capabilities, 
while also tries to teach the concepts - similar to [@tjdevries's](https://github.com/tjdevries) version in OCAML. 
This is not meant to be the fastest, or the most idiomatic, but rather a learning experience.

Based on the initial version by [@MarioGK](https://github.com/MarioGK)

For more optimized version, see [csharp2](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ts-rust-zig-deez/tree/master/csharp2) version, 
that is more akin to the book. Thanks to [@leo-costa](https://github.com/leo-costa) and [@redducks100](https://github.com/redducks100) for a great work!
