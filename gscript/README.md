## Google App Scripts Version

Most of this is very similar to the javascript version. However some stuff has been changed so it is compatible with Google App Scripts. Additionally the Code.gs can work by responding to E-Mails which contain "pls lexer deez" in the Subject.

### Testing

If you want to test the e-mail thingy, you can write an E-Mail to mangoworksbeta@gmail.com

Currently it won't work when receiving the same subject, so make your subject as unique as possible and just include "pls lexer deez" somewhere in the subject.

### Example

Subject: Helllooooo pls lexer deez thank you.
Body: let x = 5;
